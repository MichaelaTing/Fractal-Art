# Introduction

Fractals are complex geometric shapes that exhibit self-similarity at different scales. They are often generated using iterative algorithms and can produce stunning visual patterns. This repository provides Python implementations of several well-known fractals, allowing you to generate and visualize them easily.

The repository includes the following fractals:

1. **Cantor Set** : A simple fractal that consists of iteratively removing the middle third of a line segment.
2. **Hexaflake** : A fractal derived from a hexagon, where each hexagon is replaced by a smaller hexagon.
3. **L-System** : A type of formal grammar used to generate complex shapes through recursive rules.
4. **Leaves** : Fractal patterns that resemble leaves, generated using recursive algorithms.
5. **Mandelbrot Set** : A famous fractal set in the complex plane, known for its intricate and infinitely detailed boundary.

Happy fractaling!
